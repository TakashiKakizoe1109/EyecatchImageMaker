![capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TakashiKakizoe1109/eyecatch-image-maker/main/docs/capture.png)

It is very troublesome to prepare eye catching images for blog posts. I want to prepare a simple eye catching image that shows one image and a title. And I want to continue to use it in the future.

* Drag & Drop to upload images
* Adjust images in the sidebar
* Auto save settings data
* Image download or node screenshot
